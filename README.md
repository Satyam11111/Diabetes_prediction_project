### **Diabetes Prediction Project in Machine Learning**

#### **Objective**
The goal of the diabetes prediction project is to create a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health parameters. This project uses a classification algorithm to analyze the input data and classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.

#### **Dataset Used**
The **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** is one of the most commonly used datasets for this type of project. It is publicly available on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##### **Dataset Features**
The dataset typically contains medical diagnostic measurements for women aged 21 years and older of Pima Indian heritage. It includes the following attributes:
1. **Pregnancies:** Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
2. **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
3. **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. **SkinThickness:** Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
5. **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A score indicating the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
8. **Age:** Age of the person (years).
9. **Outcome:** Target variable (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).

#### **Steps in the Project**

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**
   - Use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
   - Use Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

   # Load dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
   ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and distributions of features using histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Example:  
     ```python
     data.info()  
     data.describe()  
     import seaborn as sns
     sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
     ```

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (if any) using techniques like mean/median imputation.
   - Normalize or standardize the data to improve model performance.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
     ```python
     X = data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
     y = data['Outcome']
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     ```

4. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Choose a classification algorithm like:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Train the model:
     ```python
     model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Example:
     ```python
     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
     print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     ```

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the model’s parameters for better performance.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Save the trained model using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle` and integrate it into a web application using Flask or Django.

#### **Key Insights**
- The dataset provides rich features for analyzing health patterns.
- The model helps healthcare professionals predict diabetes risk and make informed decisions.
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression are commonly used due to their robustness and interpretability.

### **Project 1: Diabetes Prediction**

**Introduction:**
Hello, Ma’am! My first project is focused on **Diabetes Prediction**. The objective of this project was to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various health-related features. I used a well-known dataset from **Kaggle**, specifically the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical data for women aged 21 years and older.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset includes 768 instances and 9 features (columns), such as:
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies the patient has had
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (in mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin level (in mu U/ml)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A score based on family history that indicates the likelihood of diabetes
- **Outcome**: The target variable, where 0 indicates non-diabetic and 1 indicates diabetic

The dataset has 500 **non-diabetic** and 268 **diabetic** instances.

**Data Preprocessing:**
I applied **StandardScaler** to standardize the data, as scaling the features helps the machine learning model perform better, especially in algorithms like SVM. I used the following approach:
- `StandardScaler().fit_transform(x)` to standardize the dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets using `train_test_split()` with a 80-20 ratio.

**Model Selection:**
For this classification problem, I used **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, which is a powerful supervised learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks like this one. The SVM algorithm is effective for distinguishing between two classes (diabetic and non-diabetic) by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates them.

```python
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data (Assuming 'data' is preprocessed and cleaned)
X = data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
y = data['Outcome']

# Standardizing the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing and training the model
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
train_predictions = clf.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy on training data
train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, train_predictions)
# Accuracy on test data
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, test_predictions)

print(f"Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")
```

**Testing with Sample Input:**
To check the prediction for a new patient, I created a sample input data with the following attributes:
- **Pregnancies**: 5
- **Glucose**: 166
- **Blood Pressure**: 72
- **Skin Thickness**: 19
- **Insulin**: 175
- **BMI**: 22.7
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: 0.6
- **Age**: 51

I used this input to see if the model correctly classifies the patient as diabetic or not. I converted the input data into a NumPy array for the model to process.

```python
input_data = (5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 22.7, 0.6, 51)
input_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_scaled = scaler.transform([input_array])
prediction = clf.predict(input_scaled)
print(f"Prediction: {'Diabetic' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Non-diabetic'}")
```

**Challenges Faced:**
- One challenge I faced was ensuring that the data was correctly preprocessed and scaled, as incorrect scaling can affect model performance. 
- Handling missing or invalid data was also a challenge, which I managed by performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to check for any anomalies and handling missing values appropriately.

**Other Algorithms Tried:**
Initially, I tried other machine learning algorithms such as:
- **Logistic Regression**: A simpler classifier but did not perform as well as SVM in this case.
- **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method, but SVM had a better classification accuracy in this case.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN was not optimal for this dataset as it was more sensitive to feature scaling, and did not perform as well on the test set.

**EDA and Feature Engineering:**
- I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.
- I used **correlation matrices** and **box plots** to identify potential features and outliers.
- Feature selection was done based on domain knowledge and the correlation between features.

**Conclusion:**
- The final model, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a **linear kernel**, performed well on the test set with a high accuracy rate.
- The project helped me understand how to preprocess data, select the right model, and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy.
- I was able to deploy the model to predict whether new input data would classify a patient as diabetic or non-diabetic.
